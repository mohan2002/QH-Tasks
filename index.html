            <h1>Why I love him</h1>
            <p>My favourite Celebrity is Virat Kohli.I love his batting style and his aggression and the energy he creates around the team. He is more consistent batsman and a run machine for India. His stats are mind blowing numbers.  As a fan I would love to see him reaching more heights.</p>

            <h1>His commitment:</h1>
            <p>Virat Kohli always tries to give 100% in each and every time he goes out to play on the field. He gave his 100% during 2014 World T20 but unfortunately India lost in the final. The next time in 2016 too he gave his 100% but still the team couldn't get through to finals. He played with stitches on his hand during IPL 2016 and scored a century for his side. As a person he gave his everything and still gives it without fail almost each and every time.</p>

            <h1>His professionalism:</h1>
            <p>He has each and every quality that is needed to become the best cricketer. He may act aggressively on the field but after the match is over, he is as friendly as any other human being with opponents. Even his opponents praise him for this quality.</p>

            <h1>His ability to overcome failures:</h1>
            <p>Each and every time someone has pointed out at his abilities, Virat has always answered them with his bat. The performance in recent test series in England stands as a showcase of his abilities. He shut each and every critic's mouth who said that he couldn't play the swinging Dukes ball.</p>
